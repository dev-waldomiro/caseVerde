  - Oh, my dear Bacamarte
  - When I heard the news that the population took the parliament and decided to
    destroy the Casa Verde, I decided to write to you.
  - 'Not only they called this well-intended building the Bastille of human reason,
    they are blind to the illuminating power of science. '
  - Hope everything works out.
