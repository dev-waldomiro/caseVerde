  - Now this is funny.
  - The simple barber who commanded the Manjicas, the so-called revolution of the
    people, decided to let you continue your work because of your background.
  - Seems to me he had come to reason, but another barber took him out of power and
    established the old lawmakers into power.
  - "Itagua\xED sure sounds fun. I should come visit you someday."
