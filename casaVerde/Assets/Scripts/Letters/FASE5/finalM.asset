  - "Dear Sim\xE3o Bacamarte,"
  - I heard you achieved success in treating every nut case in your simple town.
    Once you publish your findings, the world is going to turn over.
  - But there is one more case for you to solve before that.
  - "It\u2019s time for you to be interned in the Casa Verde."
  - From yours truly,
  - "Dr. Sim\xE3o Bacamarte"
